- 🍳 Cook time: 20 min
- 🍽️ Servings: 9-10 biscuits

## Ingredients

- 1 stick (½ cup / 113g) unsalted butter
- 2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting
- 2 tablespoons (25g) granulated sugar
- 2½ teaspoons (12g) baking powder
- 1 teaspoon (6g) fine sea salt
- ½ tablespoon (4g) ground cinnamon
- ½ cup + 2 tablespoons (150ml) cold whole milk
- 4 tablespoons (½ stick / 57g) unsalted butter (for glaze)
- ¼ cup (50g) granulated sugar (for glaze)
- 1 teaspoon (3g) ground cinnamon (for glaze)

## Directions

1. In a saucepan, melt 1 stick of butter over medium heat. Swirl until it foams, turns golden brown, and smells nutty. Pour into a bowl and refrigerate until solid and cold (30-45 minutes).
2. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, 2 tablespoons sugar, baking powder, salt, and ½ tablespoon cinnamon.
3. Cut the cold browned butter into cubes. Using a pastry cutter or your fingers, work it into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs.
4. Make a well in the center and pour in the cold milk. Gently stir with a fork until a shaggy dough forms.
5. Turn dough onto a floured surface. Gently knead 4-5 times, then press into a rectangle. Fold the dough into thirds like a letter. Rotate 90 degrees, press out, and repeat the folding process 3 more times.
6. After the final fold, shape dough into a 1-inch thick square. Trim off the edges with a floured knife, then cut into 9 equal squares. Gather scraps and shape into 1-2 more biscuits.
7. Preheat oven to 425°F (218°C). Place biscuits close together in a buttered skillet or on a parchment-lined sheet.
8. Bake for 18-22 minutes, until tops are golden brown.
9. While biscuits bake, melt the 4 tablespoons of butter for the glaze. Mix ¼ cup sugar with 1 teaspoon cinnamon in a small bowl.
10. As soon as biscuits come out of the oven, brush tops liberally with melted butter, then immediately sprinkle or dip in the cinnamon sugar mixture. Serve warm.
