- ‚è≤Ô∏è Prep time: 20 min
- üçΩÔ∏è Servings: 8

## Ingredients

- 4 eggs
- 100 g sugar
- 500 g mascarpone
- 300 g savoiardi biscuits
- coffee at room temperature
- cocoa powder

## Directions

1. Separate albumen and yolks and beat the latter with the sugar in a bowl.
2. Add the mascarpone and stir until uniform.
3. In another bowl, beat the albumens until stiff.
4. Add beaten albumens to the mascarpone cream gradually, stirring gently to not destroy the foam.
5. Cover the bottom of a baking tray with a layer of cream.
6. Cover it with a layer of savoiardi biscuits soaked in coffee.
7. Add another layer of cream, then another of coffee-soaked savoiardi.
   Savoiardi of the second layer should be orthogonal to those of the first, so that the structure is more solid and slices collapse less when they are moved.
8. Add one last layer of cream.
9. Sprinkle cocoa powder on top.
10. Store in the fridge for three hours.
