## Ingredients

- 2 cleaned rabbits
- butter
- 2 hard-boiled egg yolks
- minced sweet herbs (basil and/or rosemary)
- lemon
- nutmeg
- cayenne (optional)

## Directions

1. Boil 2 cleaned rabbits until very tender. 
2. Take them out to cool. 
3. When cold, cut them in pieces as for carving, and peel off the skin. Then with a fork pull all the meat from the bones, first loosening it with a knife. 
4. Put it into a stew-pan with plenty of cream, or some bits of fresh butter rolled in flour; some minced sweet herbs, some grated fresh lemon rind, and some hard-boiled yolks of eggs crumbled. Season with cayenne and nutmeg. 
5. Cover it, and let it simmer till it comes to a boil. Then immediately take it off the stove, and transfer it to a deep dish. 

Serve it up hot. This is a side dish at dinner.
