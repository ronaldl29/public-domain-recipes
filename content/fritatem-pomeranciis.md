_Fritatem pomeranciis_ means "orange omelette" in Latin, but in fact it is a cream made by cooking eggs, which do not coagulate because of orange juice.

It is a medieval recipe, so it had to adapted because some ingredients are no longer available.
Some versions include the juice of half a lemon, but the result is rather sour: if you like it, I recommend adding only a few drops thereof.
