_Casio in pastelletto_ means roughly "cheese treat" in vernacular Italian.

It is a medieval recipe and the taste changes a lot depending on the cheese you choose, so there are no exact quantities for the ingredients, and the dish may be considered a main one or a sweet (I think it was probably a dessert, though).
You will probably have to do some trial and error before you get a good result.
