This is a basic recipe from which many variants can be created.
For example, you could add powedered cocoa (4 tsp), honey (4 tsp), or grated chocolate (80 g).
You may also use mashed fruit, but since it contains much water you would then have to add flour to restore the original consistency of the dough.

## Ingredients

- 8 servings [shortcrust pastry](/shortcrust-pastry)

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 170 °C in static mode.
2. Create small balls of dough, place them on baking paper and flatten them slightly.
   They won't rise, so you're deciding here the size of the biscuits.
3. Cook in the oven.
   It should take about 45 minutes but it depends on the size and shape of the biscuits, so you would do better to start checking after 30.
