## Ingredients

- Half a pound of butter.
- Two pounds of flour, sifted
- Half a pint of milk, or cold water.
- A salt-spoonful of salt.

## Directions

1. Cut up the butter in the flour, and put the salt to it. Wet it to a stiff dough with the milk or water. Mix it well with a knife.
2. Throw some flour on the paste-board, take the dough out of the pan, and knead it very well.
3. Roll it out into a large thick sheet, and beat it very hard on both sides with the rolling-pin. Beat it a long time.
4. Cut it out with a tin, or cup, into small round thick cakes. Beat each cake on both sides, with the rolling-pin. Prick them, with a fork. Put them in buttered pans, and bake them of a light brown in a slow oven.
