Venezuelan Arepas (not to be confused with Colombian Arepas) are a tipical venezuelan dish.
They can be filled with dozens of things, and each presentation has a particular name, but they're still arepas.

- ⏲️ Prep time: 10 min
- 🍳 Cook time: 5 min
- 🍽️ Servings: 3-4

## Ingredients

- 2 ½ cups of water
- 2 cups of precooked corn flour
- a pinch of salt
- delicatessen to taste

## Directions

1. Combine the water, the precooked corn flour, and a little bit of salt in a large mixing bowl.
2. Mix the ingredients by hand until no clumps remain in the resulting dough and it has a smooth but solid consistency.
3. Preheat a pan with oil over low heat.
4. Take a piece of dough and form a ball the size of the palm of your hand.
5. Carefully slap the ball side by side to make a disk neither too thick nor too thin.
6. Repeat the process with the remainder of the dough.
7. Put the arepas in the preheated pan and wait for it approximately 2 minutes and a half to flip it over.
8. When both sides are cooked, take them out of the pan.
9. Cut through the middle of the arepas with a butter knife, and brush them with butter.
10. Fill them with delicatessen to taste (ham, cheese, beans, mortadella, eggs, etc.)
