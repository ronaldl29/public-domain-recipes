- ‚è≤Ô∏è Prep time: 30 min
- üç≥ Cook time: 45 min
- üçΩÔ∏è Servings: 15-20

## Ingredients

- 300 g flour
- 180 g sugar
- 3 eggs
- 120 g butter
- 200 yogurt (raw or flavoured)
- Instant yeast
- Powdered sugar (optional)
- 100 g fruit of your choice (optional)

## Directions

1. Beat the yolks with the sugar.
2. Add the butter and stir until uniform.
3. Add the flour. You may sieve it to prevent lumps. Stir until uniform.
4. Add the yogurt and stir until uniform.
5. Beat the albumens in another bowl, then add them to the compound and stir until uniform.
6. The compound should now be thick, but still liquid enough to be poured.
   If it's too thick, you may adjust it by adding yogurt or milk.
7. Add the yeast and stir.
8. Pour into a mould.
   If you want to add fruit, cut it to small pieces or slices and add it after 2/3 of the compound, then cover with the remaining.
   Alternatively, you may add it on top: it will sink during cooking.
9. You may now sprinkle powdered sugar on top, to create a thin, sweet crust
10. Cook in pre-heated oven at 180 ¬∞C.
   This will take about 45 minutes, but start checking frequently after 30.
