Polenta is basically cereal flour boiled in water until thick.
It was a common peasant dish in many areas of Italy, thus many versions exist,
varying in consistency (from almost liquid to thick enough to make slices) and
cereals used.

Polenta is not to be eaten alone; instead, it may be served in a variety of
ways:

- as a side dish, often with meat
- with a side dish, like peas
- with a sauce, such as meat sauce or tomato sauce
- transformed in a main dish melting in it a slice of a savoury cheese
