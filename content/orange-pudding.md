## Ingredients

- One large orange, of a deep colour, and smooth thin rind.
- One lime.
- A quarter of a pound of powdered white sugar.
- A quarter of a pound of fresh butter.
- Three eggs.
- A table-spoonful of mixed wine and brandy.
- A tea-spoonful of rose-water.

## Directions

1. Grate the yellow rind of the orange and lime, and squeeze the juice into a saucer or soup-plate, taking out all the seeds.
2. Stir the butter and sugar to a cream.
3. Beat the eggs as light as possible, and then stir them by degrees into the pan of butter and sugar. Add, gradually, the liquor and rose-water, and then by degrees, the orange and lime. Stir all well together.
4. Have ready a sheet of puff-paste made of five ounces of sifted flour, and a quarter of a pound of fresh butter. Lay the paste in a buttered soup-plate. Trim and notch the edges, and then put in the mixture. Bake it about half an hour, in a moderate oven. Grate loaf-sugar over it, before you send it to table.
