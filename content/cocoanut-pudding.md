## Ingredients

- A quarter of a pound of cocoa-nut, grated.
- A quarter of a pound of powdered white sugar.
- Three ounces and a half of fresh butter.
- The whites only of six eggs.
- A table-spoonful of wine and brandy mixed.
- Half a tea-spoonful of rose-water.

## Directions

1. Break up a cocoa-nut, and take the thin brown skin carefully off, with a knife. Wash all the pieces in cold water, and then wipe them dry, with a clean towel. Weigh a quarter of a pound of cocoa-nut, and grate it very fine, into a soup-plate.
2. Stir the butter and sugar to a cream, and add the liquor and rose-water gradually to them.
3. Beat the whites only, of six eggs, till they stand alone on the rods; and then stir the beaten white of egg, gradually, into the butter and sugar. Afterwards, sprinkle in, by degrees, the grated cocoa-nut, stirring hard all the time. Then stir all very well at the last.
4. Have ready a puff-paste, sufficient to cover the bottom, sides, and edges of a soup-plate. Put in the mixture, and bake it in a moderate oven, about half an hour.
5. Sprinkle granulated sugar over it, when cool.
