- ⏲️ Prep time: 15 min
- 🍳 Cook time: 45 min
- 🍽️ Servings: 2

## Ingredients

- 1 medium-sized tomato
- 1 sweet pepper
- 1 courgette
- 1 elongated aubergine
- 100-150 g grated bread
- about 50 g grated Parmigiano cheese
- parsley (fresh is best, dry is fine)
- extra virgin olive oil
- salt (optional)

## Directions

1. Cut all the vegetables in half on the long side.
   You may remove the seeds and some of the pulp from the tomato and the courgette, but not too much or you will get just burnt vegetable skin.
2. Place the vegetables on baking paper in a baking tray.
3. Sprinkle parsley over the vegetables, then, if you want, a little salt.
4. Add copious grated bread, then sprinkle Parmigiano cheese all over it.
4. Add enough olive oil to wet all the bread.
   If you don't use enough oil, grated bread won't stick together and may burn.
5. Bake for about 45 minutes in the oven pre-heated to 170 °C.
